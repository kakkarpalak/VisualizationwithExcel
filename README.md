I have created some visualizations to demonstrate car sales and profits for each dealer.

Following are the visualizations on each sheet in CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx file:

TASK 1: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID - as a bar chart, and change the chart title to Quantity Sold by Dealer ID (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet1, and use Format on the Chart tab to change the chart title)

TASK 2: Profit by Date and Model - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of Profit by Date and Model (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet2, and use Chart Title on the Chart tab to change the chart title)

TASK 3: Profit by Year and Dealer ID - as a column chart, titled Profit by Year and Dealer ID with the data columns in red (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet3, and use Format on the Chart tab to change the chart title and to format the series fill color in red)

TASK 4: Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID - as a line chart, titled Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID. Also remove the horizontal gridlines from the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green. (Hint: Use the pivot table on Sheet4, use Gridlines in the Axes group on the Chart tab to remove the gridlines, and use Format on the Chart tab to change the chart title, to move the legend, and to format the series outline color in green)
